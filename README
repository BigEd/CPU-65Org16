This project is a placeholder because the 65Org16 is a fork of
verilog-6502 by Arlet Ottens

Please go there and have a look!

https://github.com/BigEd/verilog-6502

The 65Org16 is a CPU core with:
  - 32-bit address space
    - by using 16-bit bytes
  - with no specific support for 8-bit bytes
  - with BCD mode as unspecified behaviour
  - and otherwise all opcodes and addressing modes like NMOS 6502

This core has run at 50MHz on FPGA but is still early stage.
